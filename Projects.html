<!-- if having a left bar of picture links on previous page have a right bar here
will want a seperate space maybe two little boxes of hyperlinks for other projects
e.g. charity project and one just called projects just with one word names
just a space for completeness and have the more relevant ones in current and Recent
with pictures links, what will happen a little bio description for each or even
a template with the nature of the project
would be nice to have a space too for concepts and a list of things would like to <!DOCTYPE html>
