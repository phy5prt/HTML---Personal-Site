  <h3>Personal Life</h3>
  <p>

    I enjoy making programs with friends both games; at the moment I'm making a game for steam. <br>
    and practical Apps like a pet needs reminder app and a house flipper AR own home visualiser.<br> <!-- remove if not done it by time post website -->
    Following the DND revival I find it strange that I can now openly admit as a kid for years I played DND with nine of my friends<br>
    And as an adult rather than bridge club or bowling I run a bespoke campaign for my adult friends. If you don't know what DND is, lets just say <br>
    emprov acting, team problem solving to a thematic setting, with an event organiser providing the challenges and obsticals (thats me!). And if that sounds ace no need to google<br>
    <br>
    I also go through periods of writing, and painting though I have never sold either, but my paintings are popular, and loved by the people I do them for. <br>
    I go to the gym though Im not convinced that's a notable hobby more a necessity. <br>
    I cook, clean and dance; though none of them well.

    I garden though only occasionaly because I have done it for years and run projects in it so I'm efficient.<br>

    <br><strong>But really I PROGRAM!</strong> <sub><em>(and watch a bit of SC2)</em></sub>
